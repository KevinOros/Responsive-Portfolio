			The Lochness coder...

		<p> A woman came to my window screaming how her son tripped over my bear skin rug.She claims someone has to pay her son's medical bills. I asked her how much money it would cost, her son wasn't hurt. She says "about tree fiddy." I then noticed the child was actually a basketball with googly eyes glued to it and the mom was a 12ft tall monster from the Mesozoic Era and I said "Damn it, Loch Ness Monster, I dont have no tree fiddy, get out of here and take your basketball son with you!</p>
